                <h3>AIB Mullingar: June 2022 </h3>
                <p>Stole over â‚¬100,000 from this establishment. For this project I mapped out the building blueprints, took detailed notes of the staff behaviour over several months, and executed the hesit. I managed a small team of 3 other thiefs, ensuring morale was high leading up to the day. I micro managed the team, and ensured everyone was aware of their tasks on the day.</p></div>
